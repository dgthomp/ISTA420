1. FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY

1. The FROM clause specify the name of the table you want to query.

1. The WHERE clause specify a predicate or logical expression to filter the rows returned by the FROM phase.

1. The GROUP BY phase arrange the rows returned by the previous logical query processing phase in groups.

1. The HAVING clause is a group filter. Only groups for which the HAVING predicate evaluates to TRUE are returned by the HAVING phase to the next logical query processing phase. Groups for which the predicate evaluates to FALSE or UNKNOWN are discarded.

1. The SELECT clause is where you specify the attributes (columns) you want to return in the result table of the query.

1. The DISTINCT clause is use to handle only distinct or unique occurrences of known values.

1. You use the ORDER BY clause to sort the rows in the output for presentation purposes.

1. The LIMIT clause is used to set an upper limit on the number of tuples returned by SQL.

1. The TOP filter is a proprietary T-SQL feature you can use to limit the number or percentage of rows your query returns.

1. With the OFFSET clause you indicate how many rows to skip, and with the FETCH clause you indicate how many rows to filter after the skipped.
